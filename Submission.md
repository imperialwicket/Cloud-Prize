## Which Categories Best Fit Your Submission and Why?

Best Contribution to Operational Tools, Availability, and Manageability

I aim to reduce entry barriers and ease initial setup for new users. If we can collectively enhance standards and establish best practices along the way, that is even better.

## Describe your Submission

I am generating AMIs that aim to be deploy-ready with minimal alterations by an end user. The idea is that someone should not need to ssh into the server to get a pre-built war installed and running. 

I plan to support these AMIs with puppet modules and potentially full manifests for generation. However, the core product (to date) is the output AMIs.

## Provide Links to Github Repo's for your Submission

I plan to collect announcements at [imperialwicket.com](http://imperialwicket.com/tag/netflix). I will keep an updated list of the latest releases here, as well as information regarding the puppet repository (once available).
