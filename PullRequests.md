## Project
I'm creating a number of AMIs with pre-installed Netflix OSS projects/services and an accompanying set of puppet manifests/modules to maintain, update, and ease personalization.

I plan to collect announcements at [imperialwicket.com](http://imperialwicket.com/tag/netflix). I will keep an updated list of the latest releases here, as well as information regarding the puppet repository (once available).
